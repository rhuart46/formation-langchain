This repo saves my exercises from a
[Udemy masterclass on LangChain and related topics](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass).

### Usage

Each directory contains an (iterative) exercise code relating to a part of the masterclass,
and is to be opened in an IDE as a standalone project.

I used `pyenv` to work with Python 3.11 and `pyenv-virtualenv` for creating the distinct environments.
